2:T544,In 1992, our founder Sh. Rajbir Jaglan embarked on an ambitious endeavour to redefine legal representation by simplifying the law for the common man and offering personalised and compassionate legal counsel. His unwavering dedication to his clients and passion for justice quickly earned him a stellar reputation for excellence and reliability. His initial practice later evolved into Jaglan Law Offices. As the years passed, our services grew, and so did our practice - thanks to word-of-mouth referrals and a loyal client base. From humble beginnings in Panipat, our practice expanded all across Haryana. This in itself was no small feat and could not have been managed without a team of dedicated professionals, old and new, who today form the core of Jaglan Law Offices. Keeping up with our aim to make justice and transparency in legal practice accessible to all clients, the operations of Jaglan Law Offices were also expanded to Delhi, Chandigarh, and Punjab. Over the years, Jaglan Law Offices has evolved and expanded, adapting to the changing legal landscape and the diverse needs of our clients. However, our core values have remained steadfast, and today, we are proud to be known as a law firm that combines the warmth and personal touch of a family business with the professionalism and expertise expected of a reputable organisation.0:["sFcFVWHMOUm9V1vDLLWZU",[[["",{"children":["history",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",{"children":["history",{"children":["__PAGE__",{},[["$L1",["$","div",null,{"className":"maincontent","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"heading","children":"Our History"}],["$","p",null,{"children":"$2"}]]}]],null],null]},["$","$L3",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children","history","children"],"error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L4",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","notFoundStyles":"$undefined","styles":null}],null]},[["$","html",null,{"lang":"en","children":["$","body",null,{"className":"__className_36bd41","children":[["$","$L5",null,{}],["$","main",null,{"className":"layout_main__mXTwS","children":["$","$L3",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children"],"error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L4",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":[["$","title",null,{"children":"404: This page could not be found."}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"fontFamily":"system-ui,\"Segoe UI\",Roboto,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif,\"Apple Color Emoji\",\"Segoe UI Emoji\"","height":"100vh","textAlign":"center","display":"flex","flexDirection":"column","alignItems":"center","justifyContent":"center"},"children":["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","style",null,{"dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"body{color:#000;background:#fff;margin:0}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,.3)}@media (prefers-color-scheme:dark){body{color:#fff;background:#000}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,.3)}}"}}],["$","h1",null,{"className":"next-error-h1","style":{"display":"inline-block","margin":"0 20px 0 0","padding":"0 23px 0 0","fontSize":24,"fontWeight":500,"verticalAlign":"top","lineHeight":"49px"},"children":"404"}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"display":"inline-block"},"children":["$","h2",null,{"style":{"fontSize":14,"fontWeight":400,"lineHeight":"49px","margin":0},"children":"This page could not be found."}]}]]}]}]],"notFoundStyles":[],"styles":null}]}],["$","$L6",null,{}],["$","$L7",null,{}]]}]}],null],null],[[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"./_next/static/css/5a93a2b9dea57f98.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined"}]],[null,"$L8"]]]]]
