2:T4a3,Banking and finance-related litigation encompasses a range of laws governing financial transactions, banking activities, and relationships between financial institutions and their clients. These laws clarify the terms of loan agreements, the processes for securing mortgaged properties and resolving insurance-related disputes, and facilitate compliance with financial regulations. We provide legal counsel and advocacy services to both organizations such as banks as well as individuals, helping them navigate the intricacies of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (SARFAESI) Act and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). The SARFAESI Act enables financial institutions to take effective measures for asset recovery in instances of loan default. Meanwhile, the IBC addresses issues related to insolvency — when an individual or business cannot pay their debts and fulfil financial obligations — and outlines the mechanism for debt resolution and bankruptcy proceedings. We assist our clients with understanding their options, determining the best course of action, and ensuring their rights and interests are protected.0:["sFcFVWHMOUm9V1vDLLWZU",[[["",{"children":["advocacy",{"children":["banking-finance",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",{"children":["advocacy",{"children":["banking-finance",{"children":["__PAGE__",{},[["$L1",["$","div",null,{"className":"maincontent","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"heading","children":"Banking & Finance Laws"}],["$","p",null,{"children":"$2"}]]}]],null],null]},["$","$L3",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children","advocacy","children","banking-finance","children"],"error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L4",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","notFoundStyles":"$undefined","styles":null}],null]},["$","$L3",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children","advocacy","children"],"error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L4",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","notFoundStyles":"$undefined","styles":null}],null]},[["$","html",null,{"lang":"en","children":["$","body",null,{"className":"__className_36bd41","children":[["$","$L5",null,{}],["$","main",null,{"className":"layout_main__mXTwS","children":["$","$L3",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children"],"error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L4",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":[["$","title",null,{"children":"404: This page could not be found."}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"fontFamily":"system-ui,\"Segoe UI\",Roboto,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif,\"Apple Color Emoji\",\"Segoe UI Emoji\"","height":"100vh","textAlign":"center","display":"flex","flexDirection":"column","alignItems":"center","justifyContent":"center"},"children":["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","style",null,{"dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"body{color:#000;background:#fff;margin:0}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,.3)}@media (prefers-color-scheme:dark){body{color:#fff;background:#000}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,.3)}}"}}],["$","h1",null,{"className":"next-error-h1","style":{"display":"inline-block","margin":"0 20px 0 0","padding":"0 23px 0 0","fontSize":24,"fontWeight":500,"verticalAlign":"top","lineHeight":"49px"},"children":"404"}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"display":"inline-block"},"children":["$","h2",null,{"style":{"fontSize":14,"fontWeight":400,"lineHeight":"49px","margin":0},"children":"This page could not be found."}]}]]}]}]],"notFoundStyles":[],"styles":null}]}],["$","$L6",null,{}],["$","$L7",null,{}]]}]}],null],null],[[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"./_next/static/css/5a93a2b9dea57f98.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined"}]],[null,"$L8"]]]]]
